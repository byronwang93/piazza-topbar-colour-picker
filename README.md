If you're a University student, chances are, you've used Piazza before, a collaborative platform to receive help from peers and instructors. However, one of the most fatal flaws would have to be the "bland" colour scheme that Piazza offers.

This is why my team created a chrome extension called Piazza Topbar Colour Changer which allows the user to permanently change their Piazza topbar to any unique hex code/colour that the user desires!
